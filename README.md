# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

Project/Goals
Test my understanding of Transforming and anlysing data in SQL

Process
STEP 1
Load the data from
Clean the data by removing unwanted rows and columns,
Check for null values
Run quality assurance on dataset, making sure that rows or data was not deleted mistakenly

STEP 2
Analize the data with queries to specific questions to generate answers

Results
- The data showed the product that generated the most and least revenue amoung all the products being sold
identifying the products that had the highest and least orders from the site through the combination of data from the sales_by_product table which tells if the product was sold or not.

-It gives an idea of what product to improve sales in, product to focus on to maximize profits and ones to discontinue to prevent loss. Using products, analytics and sales_by_product tables.

Challenges 

-There were technical issues associated with loading the data e.g security and permission surrounding the dataset.
-Understanding the header names of the columns and what they represented was challenging during creating the tables process. 
-Knowing what type of data was associated with each column was also an issue associated with the dataset.
-identifying how the tables were related was a major challenge.


Future Goals
Create my own tables that expanded on the data uniqueness and explored better relationships with the dataset.
